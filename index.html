  <h2>Digital Audio Workstation</h2>
  <p>
    A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic device or application
    software used for recording, editing and producing audio files.
    DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations from a single software
    program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit,
    all the way to a highly complex configuration of numerous components
    controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration,
    modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and
    mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    DAWs are used for the production and recording of music, songs, speech,
    radio, television, soundtracks, podcasts, sound effects and
    nearly any other situation where complex recorded audio is needed.
